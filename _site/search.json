If you want to contact me directly, you can contact me at my email, fearlessfan03 at gmail dot com.\nI made this project because I’m passionate about golf and I wanted to explore what affects the score the most. If you want to see details, here is my github repo - https://github.com/PythonGoaler/golf-score-analyzing\nThis project was created as a part of Kane’s Data Sciece Bootcamp - https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/."

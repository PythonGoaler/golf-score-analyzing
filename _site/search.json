If you want to contact me directly, you can contact me at my email, fearlessfan03 @ gmail dot com.\nI made this project because I’m passionate about golf and I wanted to explore what affects the score the most. If you want to see details, here is my github repo - https://github.com/PythonGoaler/golf-score-analyzing\nThis project was created as a part of Kane’s Data Sciece Bootcamp - https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/."

    "text": "What affects golf score the most?\n\nBy Zephan Shivam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever watched golf and wondered, “Sure, many things affect the score, but what affects it the most?” I sure have wondered that. So I created this project to answer that question. It takes data from datagolf.com, where all data is golf related, and analyzes what has the most effect on the score. In this project, we see that good putting on Par 3s and Par 4s seem to make the most difference on the score."

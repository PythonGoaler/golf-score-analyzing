Hi! My name is Zephan Shivam, and I'm a middle schooler from Austin, Texas.

You can see this project and much more at my github,  <https://github.com/PythonGoaler>. 
If you want to contact me directly, you can contact me at my email, fearlessfan03 at gmail dot com.

I made this project because I'm passionate about golf and I wanted to explore what affects the score the most. If you want to see details, here is my github repo - <https://github.com/PythonGoaler/golf-score-analyzing>

This project was created as a part of Kane's Data Sciece Bootcamp -  <https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/>.

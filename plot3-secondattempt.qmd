## Relation between driving distance and score
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
golf_data <- read_csv("dg_new_course_table.csv")
```

```{r}
golf_data |> ggplot(aes(x = adj_driving_distance, y = adj_score_to_par)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) + labs(x = "Driving Distance", y = "Score")
```

#### There is not much of a correlation, which seems suprising, but makes sense when we look at the relation between accuracy and distance.

```{r}
golf_data |> ggplot(aes(x = adj_driving_distance, y = adj_driving_accuracy)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) + labs(x = "Driving Distance", y = "Driving Accuracy")
```

#### We see that the accuracy goes down when the driving distance increases, which is why driving distance is not a huge factor towards the

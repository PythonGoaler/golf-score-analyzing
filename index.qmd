```{r}
library(tidyverse)

golf_data <- read_csv(file = "dg_new_course_table.csv")
```

```{r}
 golf_data |> ggplot(mapping = aes(x = yardage, y = adj_score_to_par)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.8) + geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "green") + labs(title = "Yardage vs Score", subtitle = "Only after the yardage crosses 7100 does it have an effect on the score.", x = "Yardage", y = "Average score to Par", caption = "Data from datagolf.com") + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) 
```
